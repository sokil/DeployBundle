# Tasks

## Git

If repository is private, password will be asked on pull:

```
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

For example web server started under www-data user. To prevent asking password, 
add ssh keys to `/home/$USER/.ssh` directory, using ssh key generation tool. 

1) Generate keys: 

```
$ sudo -u www-data ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/www-data/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/www-data/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/www-data/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
...
```

2) Add public cey to your repository to fetch changes without password prompt.
3) Test your connection:
```
$ sudo -H -u www-data git pull origin master
```
